# 🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot | Task 4 – CodeAlpha Internship

This is a simple yet realistic **rule-based chatbot** built using Python, developed as part of **Task 4** during my internship at [CodeAlpha](https://www.linkedin.com/company/codealpha-internship/).

---

## 📌 Project Objective

**Goal:** Build a chatbot that can interact with users through predefined responses using only core Python concepts.  
**Requirement:** Accept basic inputs like `"hello"`, `"how are you"`, `"bye"` and return appropriate responses using conditionals, functions, and loops.

---

## ✅ Features

- 🧠 **Keyword-Based Matching** (not just exact phrases)
- 🕒 **Dynamic Responses** for current date & time
- 🎭 **Human-Like Behavior** with typing delay
- 📚 **Beginner-Friendly Codebase** using functions, loops, and dictionaries
- 💬 Clean and natural **fallback response** for unknown inputs

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Modules Used:** `time`, `datetime` (built-in only)

---

## 💡 Concepts Used

- `if-elif-else` statements
- `functions` and `lambda` expressions
- `while` loops
- `string matching` with `in` keyword
- `dictionaries` for response mapping
- `datetime` for real-time responses

---

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Clone the repository or copy the code.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python chatbot.py
